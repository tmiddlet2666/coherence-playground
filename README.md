# Coherence Playground

## Introduction

This repository contains various Coherence related projects that I have found useful.

> Note: These projects don't reflect the recommended 'Production' way of setting and running various Coherence
bits and pieces, but are a good starting point for playing with and trying things out with Coherence. 
> For the official way/ best practises of doing setting up Coherence, please refer to the [official Coherence commercial documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/en/middleware/standalone/coherence/14.1.1.2206/).

## Requirements

To get the best out of these projects, you should have the following minimum requirements:

* JDK 17
* Maven 3.8.x
* Installed the latest Coherence CLI - [Install instructions](https://oracle.github.io/coherence-cli/docs/latest/#/docs/installation/01_installation)

Some examples require docker and docker-compose.

>Important: If you find any problems with these projects or see something that needs to 
> be changed or clarified, please [submit an issue](https://github.com/tmiddlet2666/coherence-playground/issues/new/choose).
