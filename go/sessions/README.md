# HTTP Session Management for Go

This example is the code from a blog post [here](https://medium.com/oracle-coherence/using-coherence-to-manage-http-sessions-in-go-6aa0c71201ff), that shows how Go applications can use Coherence as a HTTP session store via 
integration with the very popular "Express inspired web framework" [Fiber](https://github.com/gofiber/fiber).

## Prerequisites 

1. Docker setup using either Docker or Rancher Desktop
2. Go 1.23 or above
3. Your favourite IDE

See the article [Using Coherence to manage HTTP sessions in Go](https://medium.com/oracle-coherence/using-coherence-to-manage-http-sessions-in-go-6aa0c71201ff) for full details.
